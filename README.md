SYSTEM OVERVIEW

The online Hostel Registration System is web based software to provide our university 
Students accommodation to the university hostel more efficiently. This project also keeps details of the hostellers and applied students. It is headed by the faculty Dean, the university Welfare Society and the Warden. This document is intended to minimize human works and make hostel allocation is an easier job for our students and the university Welfare and hostel authorities by providing online application for hostel, selection of the students from the waiting list and complaint registration etc. 

When Students apply for a hostel, the Dean will view and confirm the year of study of the students and forward the verified applications to welfare. Then the Welfare will select the hostel for a particular student and forward the verified applications to the warden. Finally the warden will choose Bed-No and Room-No for the selected students .In addition to that, the warden also needs to certify the 4th year studentsâ€™ character. Students can view all details of the registration process and the hostel details via the website we build along this project. Also Students will get approval notification in their mails.


Technologies Used and Justification

Here we use MERN stack to make the development process smoother and easier.
MERN stack is a web development framework used to describe a specific set of JavaScript based technologies that are used in the web application development process. It consists of MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS as its working components.

1.MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON objects.
2.Express JS
A framework layered on top of NodeJS, used to build the backend of a site using NodeJS functions and structures. Since NodeJS was not developed to make websites    but rather run JavaScript on a machine, ExpressJS was developed.
3.React JS
React is used for build the user interface and the  development of single-page applications and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data.
4.Node JS
Node.js provides a JavaScript Environment which allows the user to run their code on the server.
